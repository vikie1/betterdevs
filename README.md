# BetterDevs front-end

This is a front-end for 'betterdevs' - a Spring Boot API in my portfolio.
It is written in React and the project is still in incubation.

# So what's this

Better devs is a platform where an individual will store links to those blogs/articles or even videos that they saw somewhere but have no time to read or have read but would like to revisit later. <br>
I am very sure that am not the only one who hates cluttered bookmarks. <br>
So how about all of them in one place unaffected by browser uninstalls, migrations or just some other crap incident.<br>
<strong>Actual content is not stored, just links to the contect - call it a pastebin of useful links </strong>

## Just that?

Nope it's not just that. Read on. <br>
=> Its also supposed to create a personal space to store stuff like:

<ol>
<li> Personal schedule - A simple weekly timetable will do. You can also share it if you want </li>
<li> Projects - Tell us what you are working on or just keep it private, your call </li>
<li> Personal notes or a rant after deleting production database tablesðŸ˜Ž ->ðŸ˜¬ This div aint centering ðŸ˜¢</li>
</ol>
=> Blogs that proves helpful to a large number of people will be promoted <br>
=> Since I am a Java and JavaScript fullstack developer, i'll probably put <br>
a beginner friendly collection of resources that could take you from zero Java to hero. <br>
Also resources for the Spring *, and React js <br>
=> I know all that was crap, i'll think of something useful to build, later. <br>
=> I don't know whether am busy or lazy all I know is that this project might get completed after AI takes over the worldðŸ˜‘ðŸ™ƒ
